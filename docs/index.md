## Summary

The operation of my software will use data through the NASA JPL Api. to search for Asteroids based on their closet approach to earth. Another function will be able to search for specific Asteroids with a small body ID.

## Intended users

* Amateur Astronomers and Astronomy Students.  

> As a <person who likes the subject Astronomy> I want to <use the feature or functionality (_to search for asteroids that have come close to Earth_)> so that <benefit (_I could use this data for analysis in projects or simple curiosity_).

Please avoid writing too much for the user story. In particular, if the way the user story is written makes it difficult to see the _who_, _what_, and _why_, then you probably need to re-write it more directly. (On the other hand, a user story should not simply be a re-statement of the intended user description.)

Here is one (silly) example of an intended user, along with a user story. Please note not only the conceptual structure, but the Markdown syntax used.

* People who like to use randomness in their decision-making.

    > As someone who enjoys astronomy, I need an app that lets me record data of celestial objects.

## Client component

### Functionality

* Users will be able to search for asteroids that have come close to Earth.
* Users can also search for specific asteroids with a small body ID and browse overall data. 

### Persistent data

Users can save searches within the app only. 
    
### Device/external services

Users can see data and access the NASA JPL url to see more in depth information.
    
## Server component

### Functionality

System will use a NASA API to function and get persistent data from the API.

### Persistent data

N/A. 
    
### External services

Links to NASA website will be stored.
